# AutoTaggingAndDescriptionGenerationInEcommerce
The above advanced automatic product tagging and description generation framework involves the two-stage process of CNN's feature extraction strength and further process through ViT for an improved classification and label mapping.

1. Image Processing through CNN:
First, an image of a product is fed into a CNN acting as a feature extractor. The CNN layers progressively apply convolution operations combined with ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation in order to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns of an image, such as textures, colors, and edges.
The first layers are convolutional. Further, a pooling layer compresses spatial dimensions of the feature maps: it preserves the features of the highest values only but reduces computational complexity.
The final output of CNN would be a flattened layer representing a high-level feature map summarizing the unique nature of the product. Such feature maps are passed to the subsequent model of ViT.

2. Feature Extraction and Training of ViT Model:
After the CNN stage, it is processed within the Vision Transformer (ViT) as the flattened feature map into a fixed-size patch representation corresponding to a piece of the image.
These flattened patches are passed to a linear projection layer, where they prepare the patch to be encoded. The position embeddings of ViT will allow the transformer model to preserve spatial information that's necessary to understand the structure of an image.
The patches, with positional encodings, are passed through a transformer encoder. The self-attention mechanisms within the encoder help capture long-range dependencies in the image, which, in turn, gives a more subtle view of the features of the product than does a traditional CNN alone.
Lastly, an MLP head is used at the top of the ViT to output the image label, which identifies the category or subcategory of the product.

3. Label Mapping and Feature Analysis:
The ViT output will be assigned to a label that was created and pre-defined under categories of products so that in its classification, it holds to consistency. The classed image, in a general sense, allows detailed analysis on specific features
This step extracts color of the image, which may later be broken down as finer attributes to describe a product. By applying the K-Means Clustering of the image, its major colors can be accessed that will later be associated to search and filter results.
Open Source Computer Vision Library or, in short, OpenCV is applied in detecting attributes of the shape; this function makes the system enable determination of the presence of the product as it has square forms or any other edges of circular patterns.
EasyOCR Text Extraction extracts text of the brand name or even any other text visible in the product. This extraction step is helpful in text element identification, like logos or brand labels, so that the representation of products can be made accurate.

4. Description Generation:
Using the label, color, shape, and text information that is extracted, the system will create a description. The description synthesizes all available information into one comprehensive, user-friendly story for the product. In the case of a sports shoe, for example, the description could indicate brand, color scheme, design details, mesh material, or cushioned soles to make the product attractive.

5. Benefits of End-to-End Pipeline:
The presented architecture effectively integrates localized feature extraction through the CNN with capturing global relationships using ViT. Thus, high classification accuracy for products can be attained, further enhancing user experience in an e-commerce scenario by giving more relevant results for searches and recommendations in e-commerce applications.
