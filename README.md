# AutoTaggingAndDescriptionGenerationInEcommerce
This is a more advanced framework for automatic product tagging and description generation, where an image goes through a two-stage process that combines the strength of CNNs in feature extraction and ViT in better classification and label mapping.

Image Processing through CNN:

The process begins with the sending of an image of a product through a feature extractor, usually a CNN. Subsequent layers of the CNN involve the convolution operations combined with ReLU activation and hence capture spatial hierarchies as well as patterns in the images, such as texture, colors, edges, among others.
Following the convolutional layers, a pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the feature maps by retaining only the strongest features since this is a computationally efficient operation.
The final layer of the CNN produces an output that is a flattened layer, and this means a high-level feature map of unique characteristics of products. The training model accepts as input the model of ViT.
Feature Extraction and ViT Model Training

The feature map, which comes out after exposing the CNN to further processing in the model of ViT, is divided into patches of fixed sizes, that is, a part of the image.
These patches are first fed into the linear projection layer for encoding. The ViT model contains position embeddings with these patches, which is required to enable spatial information in the context of an image's structure within the transformer model.
The patches with positional encodings are fed into the transformer encoder. In the encoder, the self-attentions can capture image long-range dependencies and more sensitively recognize the features of the product than the CNNs solely.
Finally, in the topmost layer of the ViT, the MLP head generates the output image label as a representative of the category or subcategory of the product.
Label Mapping and Feature Analysis

This label is mapped to maintain uniformity with the already determined product categories. This would give a high-level class for the image and further be used as a base for more feature-specific analysis.
There are more analyses in order to obtain specific product attributes. K-Means clustering is done to the image for the color extraction. The main colors which can be tagged for the search and filtering process will be identified.
Using OpenCV, the shape features are computed so that the system can predict structural characteristics, such as whether the product has rounded corners, square shapes, or other distinguishing outlines.
Text extraction using EasyOCR can extract brand names or any text appearing on the product. The process specifically helps in detecting textual elements, such as a logo or brand label, that are necessary in correctly portraying a product.
Description Generation:

The system further brings out the description with label, color, shape, and other textual information from the data. All of the above information synthesized yields a detailed, user-friendly story to the product. For instance, if the product is sports shoes, then the description would include a brand, the color scheme of the brand, and the kind of designs such as material of mesh or cushioning on soles to create the desire for the product.
Advantages within the End-to-End Pipeline

This method succeeded in combining the strengths CNN has in extracting local features with the capabilities of ViT in modeling global relations and thus yielding high-quality classification products and dense, visually grounded descriptions to benefit e-commerce users.
